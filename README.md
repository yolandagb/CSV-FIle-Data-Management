# Data
Description:
  I want to analyze my Company data so that I could take advantage of this info and make more money for my company (this is a highly competitive sector). No DB usage is needed, we just need to read the csv file and show the results on the screen.

Details:
Retrieve the customer with the earliest check in date.
Retrieve the customer with the latest check in date.
Retrieve a list of customer’s full names ordered alphabetically.
Retrieve a list of the companies user’s jobs ordered alphabetically.
File required fields are: Street, Zip, City, Last Check-in Date and CompanyCheck that every exception is handled accordingly

Functional notes:
The file has the following headers: First Name, Last Name, Street, Zip, City, Type, Job, Phone, Last Check-In Date and Company.
The full name of our customers is composed as First Name + Last Name.

Technical notes:
The example file has 10 rows of data (excluding the header). But it needs to work with any file.
It is recommended to log exceptions in case that a required field is empty for that row but the rest of the file is still processed.
It is recommended to log an exception in case a row contains less fields than expected but the rest of the file is still processed.
It is recommended to log an exception in case a row does not contain any data but the rest of the file is still processed.

Language is irrelevant (but preferred in Python or JavaScript)
